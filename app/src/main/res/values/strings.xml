For this reason, Tap, Tap may use some battery while running in the background.\n\nDue to its early development state, Tap, Tap has not been fully optimised yet, and battery life may improve through options in the future, but currently a slightly lower battery life is a consequence of having this feature.\n\nAdditionally, some OEM firmwares, such as MIUI or OneUI, are more aggressive at killing background tasks (including accessibility services) than Google recommends they should be. If Tap, Tap stops working on your device after being closed even with Battery Optimisation disabled, please try the following:\n• Locking the app into memory (usually from the recent apps)\n• Disabling any further battery optimisation for an app (usually under Settings > Apps or Settings > Battery)\n• Disabling MIUI Optimization in the Developer Options (MIUI only)\n• Setting Battery optimisation to \"Don\'t optimise\" in the app info (OnePlus only)\n\nMore info on apps being killed by the system and suggestions on how to resolve it for your device can be found at dontkillmyapp.com</string>

    <string name="bs_troubleshooting_content">If the gesture is not working for you, here\'s a few things you can try to get it working:\n\n• Try switching device size. While Tap, Tap attempts to guess the best size to use when choosing a model, it is not always correct\n\n• Change the sensitivity - some devices may require a higher sensitivity\n\n• Try tapping in a different position on the back. Sensors are located in different places on different devices, so you may find tapping higher, lower, or in a corner helps.\n\n• Tap a little harder. Hold your phone securely while testing this, so you don\'t drop it, but a firm tap is easier to recognise than a soft one.\n\n• Double tap quickly, but not too quickly - if you\'re too slow it may not register as a double tap (the cooldown time is about a second)</string>
