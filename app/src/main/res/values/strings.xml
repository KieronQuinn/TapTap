    <string name="bs_troubleshooting_content">If the gesture is not working for you, here\'s a few things you can try to get it working:\n\n• Try switching device size. While Tap, Tap attempts to guess the best size to use when choosing a model, it is not always correct\n\n• Change the sensitivity - some devices may require a higher sensitivity\n\n• Try tapping in a different position on the back. Sensors are located in different places on different devices, so you may find tapping higher, lower, or in a corner helps.\n\n• Tap a little harder. Hold your phone securely while testing this, so you don\'t drop it, but a firm tap is easier to recognise than a soft one.\n\n• Double tap quickly, but not too quickly - if you\'re too slow it may not register as a double tap (the cooldown time is about a second)</string>
